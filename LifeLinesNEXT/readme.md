# LifeLines NEXT

[NEXT](https://www.lifelines.nl/deelnemers/onderzoek/next) is a dutch birth cohort, started in 2016. In 2019 LifeLines hads to move to another loaction and the NEXT project stayed at in Groningen, therefore a new registration system had to be designed.

## Sample registration

In LifeLines NEXT material from Mother, Child and Father will be collected. On different Timepoints; p12, b, m1, m2, m3, father, m4, p28, m6, w2 , m9 and m12.

These sample can be registered per persontype, materialtype and timepoint. In molgenis this is arranged with visible expression.
