ALSPAC,Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children,cohort,UOB,"ALSPAC General enquiries,ALSPAC Data enquiries,ALSPAC Lab enquiries",,,United Kingdom,"Children,Mothers,Partners",,"Based at the University of Bristol, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), also known as Children of the 90s, is a world-leading birth cohort study.

Between April 1991 and December 1992 we recruited more than 14,000 pregnant women into the study and these women (some of whom had two pregnancies or multiple births during the recruitment period), the children arising from the pregnancy, and their partners have been followed up intensively over two decades.

We are the most detailed study of its kind in the world and we provide the international research community with a rich resource for the study of the environmental and genetic factors that affect a person’s health and development. Through our research we aim to inform policy and practices that will provide a better life for future generations.",10.1093/ije/dys064,,http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/,not for profit use only,,,"“The UK Medical Research Council and Wellcome (Grant ref: 217065/Z/19/Z) and the University of Bristol provide core support for ALSPAC.
